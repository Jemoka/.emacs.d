<center><h2>What D&amp;D Character Are You?</h2><i>(version 4.10)</i><br><br>

<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=750><tr><td>

The original version of this test can still be found <a 
href="http://irulethe.net/~neppyman/dndwho/orig.html" target="_blank">here</a>, if 
you're interested.  This version adds secondary classes, more detailed results, and as a much 
larger base of questions to get better results.<br><br>
Updates:<br><ul>
<li><b>v4.10</b> - (06/01/2002) Another small update.  Settled in for the summer, so I should have time to update
if necessary, although the survey is fast approaching the stage where I'd call it "complete".  I added five more
questions, some lifted from the <a href="http://irulethe.net/~neppyman/dndwho/orig.html" target="_blank">
original survey</a>, because that seems to be popular.  A word on that.. I've been told many times that the original
survey produces more accurate results.  The reason for this is that the questions are very blunt and direct, and
if you know what you want to become, it's easy to choose answers to get there.  This version is a bit more cryptic,
so if you want a bit of mystery, stick with this.  <b>PLEASE BE AWARE:</b> As this survey is hosted on my own
webspace on my school's survey, and since I'm planning to graduate at the end of the summer, the survey will be
<b>MOVING</b>.  Where exactly has yet to be determined, but I can only keep a forwarding page up for so long.  Stay
tuned; it will be announced as soon as I have space set up.<br>
<li><b>v4.00</b> - (04/30/2002) Yeah, yeah, I know I've been lazy lately, but this one's worth it for everyone
who's been complaining that the test neglected to include Monks, Gnomes, and Half-Orcs.  No longer; they're all
in, complete with some gnomish deities to go with them.  I did <i>not</i> include any orcish deities, primarily
because they're almost completely evil, and a half-orc player character (at least, a good one) would be more likely
to lean towards the human side of their nature.  If you want orcish deities to add to your ravenously evil 
character, look them up yourself.  In the meantime, enjoy the updated survey.  Also, in order to help differentiate
the additions, a couple of new answers to questions have been added.<br>
<li><b>v3.01</b> - (03/14/2002) Made a few minor cosmetic tweaks to the page over the last week or so - thanks to
everyone who sent in bug reports and such.  Also, I was informed by a Forgetten Realms-inclined friend of mine that
the stereotypical Lawful Good dwarven deity would be Moradin, so the survey has been changed updated accordingly.
Thanks for Arn!e for helping me out with that.  Also, for those who are interested in Legend of the Five Rings (L5R),
my friend Johnny put up <a href="http://members.aol.com/gaijintrader/faction.html" target="_mt">his own survey</a>,
based on my code (I helped him a bit, but he's pretty talented to begin with... *grins*).  If you're interested in
L5R, <a href="http://members.aol.com/gaijintrader/faction.html" target="_mt">head on over</a> and take his survey.<br>
<li><b>v3.00</b> - (03/03/2002) Added Forgotten Realms deities to the list of results.  Lots of them - 32, to be
specific, and the survey will match your character up with one based on alignment (primarily), and then race and
class.  The descriptions are still being finalized (expect a revision later this week), and anyone who wants to
offer some assistance should <a href="mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com">drop me a line</a>.  Also, anyone with artistic
talent who would be willing to help me out by drawing symbol pictures for all the deities (40x40 pixels would
be quite sufficient) should <a href="mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com">let me know</a>.  To take a look at the list of
deities that I'm using, click <a href="http://irulethe.net/~neppyman/dndwho/char-possible.html" 
target="_mt">here</a>.<br>
<li><b>v2.22</b> - (02/26/2002) Added one question and more answers to a few questions.  Also, redid the browser
recommendations into a neat table.  Added a link showing all possible results.  I recommend <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_mt">Mozilla</a> as the browser of choice to use for this survey; of
all the browsers I've tested, on all the platforms, it yields the best results.<br>
<li><b>v2.21</b> - (02/21/2002) Full HTML 4.01 Transitional compliance achieved!  If that doesn't fix problems
with pesky browsers, nothing will.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.figment.org/"
target="_mt">Figment</a> for the suggestions that let me pull this off.<br>
<li><b>v2.20</b> - (02/21/2002) As suggested, I took the rather naive tie-breaking 
algorithm for breaking ties with alignment, and made it much more robust.  The survey is configured to 
generate specific (e.g. Lawful Neutral) alignments associated with each question.  If that produces a single 
highest alignment, that's what you get.  If not, it sums up law vs. chaos and good vs. evil, and resolves 
ties in favor of neutrality.  From my own test runs, this produces pretty good (and accurate) results, but 
if you feel otherwise, feel free to <a href="mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com">tell me what you think</a>.<br>
<li><b>v2.10</b> - (02/19/2002) Fixed minor code bug that was improperly handling ties in primary classes.
Thanks to <a href="mailto:michael@whiterose.org">Michael Croft</a> for helping me with this!<br>
<li><b>v2.01</b> - (02/19/2002) Fixed JavaScript bug that was preventing MacOS users (and others) from viewing 
the page or taking the test.<br>
</ul><br>

This survey will attempt to, in a few short questions, determine your race, alignment, and primary/secondary
class, as a D&amp;D character.  We make no guarantees for accuracy, and this is simply for fun, so don't complain if
you feel insulted or upset by some of the things you see.  With that in mind, please take the time to read
the questions completely, as some of the answers are surprising.  Also, don't try to guess the system used
in determining these things (although you can read the source if you'd like, once you're done), because
that would really defeat the purpose.  And yes, there's some inside jokes here.<br><br>

<b>By Request:</b> If you would like to see a list of all possible results, click <a 
href="http://irulethe.net/~neppyman/dndwho/char-possible.html" target="_mt">here</a> to get that.<br><br>

<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> This test requires support for both JavaScript and pop-up windows.  If your browser 
doesn't support both of them, you're out of luck.  Unfortunately, there's no other way to do the 
survey - there's over 2000 possible results, and I have to generate them on the fly.  And since U of I 
doesn't let us run CGI scripts on their server, I'm stuck with JavaScript to do the generation.<br><br>
